Machine Learning Model Release Definition Templates
===================================================

hashicorp-aws offers a [Screwdriver template][Screwdriver CD template] that deploys
[immutable][Immutable Infrastructure] instances of Machine Learning models as REST API to AWS. It uses the
[screwdriver-template-main npm package] to assist with template validation, publishing, and tagging.

This release definition contains the following templates:

- [Deploying ML models via MLflow Docker container](#deploying-ml-models-via-mlflow-docker-container)

All templates tag the latest versions with the `latest` tag.

How to Use the Templates
------------------------

### Using the Template

[Create a Screwdriver pipeline that uses this template][Screwdriver CD - creating pipeline from template] with the following
contents:

```yaml
---
jobs:
  main:
    requires: [~pr, ~commit]
    template: QubitPi/machine-learning-model-release-definition-template-mlflow-docker@latest
    steps:
      - build-ml-models: ...
    secrets:
      - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
      - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
      - AWS_ML_PKRVARS_HCL
      - AWS_ML_TFVARS
```

The following [Screwdriver CD - steps] must be implemented:

- `build-ml-models` - Commands that [package up MLflow Python models](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.pyfunc.html#creating-custom-pyfunc-models)

The following [Screwdriver Secrets][Screwdriver CD Secrets] needs to be defined before running this template:

- [`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`](../setup#aws)
- [`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`](../setup#aws)
- **AWS_ML_PKRVARS_HCL** - A [HashiCorp Packer variable values file] with the following variable values:

  ```hcl
  aws_image_region = "us-east-2"
  ami_name         = "my-ml-ami"
  instance_type    = "t2.small"
  ml_models_path   = "/home/my-nlp-models"
  ```

  - `aws_image_region` is the [image region][AWS regions] of [AWS AMI]
  - `ami_name` is the name of the resulting AMI that will appear when managing AMIs in the AWS console or via APIs. This
  can be the same across builds, because hashicorp-aws will deregister the old AMI with the same name and replace it
  with the current built one
  - `instance_type` is the recommended [AWS EC2 instance type] running this image
  - `ml_models_path` is the absolute path to the model directory generated by the **build-ml-models** step above

- **AWS_ML_TFVARS** - A [HashiCorp Terraform variable values file] with the following variable values:

  ```hcl
  aws_ec2_region   = "us-east-2"
  ami_name            = "my-ml-ami"
  instance_type       = "t2.small"
  ec2_instance_name   = "My Machine Learning REST Service"
  ec2_security_groups = ["ML REST Service Security Group"]
  ```

  - `aws_ec2_region` is the [EC2 runtime region][AWS regions]
  - `ami_name` is the name of the published AMI; **it must be the same as the `ami_name` in AWS_ML_PKRVARS_HCL**
  - `instance_type` is the [AWS EC2 instance type] used for deployed infrastructure
  - `ec2_instance_name` is the deployed EC2 name as appeared in the instance list of AWS console; it can be arbitrary
  - `ec2_security_groups` is the [AWS Security Group] _name_ (yes, not ID, but name...)
