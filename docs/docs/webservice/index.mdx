Deploying Jersey-Jetty Based Webservice
=======================================

:::tip

- Yes, we DO NOT support Spring, never ever
- EBS volumes during build time will [automatically be removed][HashiCorp Packer delete_on_termination]

:::

Immutable Webservice by hashicorp-aws supports 2 deployment modes:

1. SSL/HTTPS
2. non-SSL/HTTPS

The first mode is very suitable for MVP such as a web app backed by a single webservice. The second mode is designed for
[microservices architecture where authentication is delegated to an API gateway]

General Deployments
-------------------

:::info

Please complete the [general setup](setup#setup) before proceeding. If you are deploying in _non-SSL/HTTPS mode_, the
[SSL section](setup#optional-setup-ssl) can be skipped.

:::

:::tip[Nginx Config in SSL/HTTPS mode]

We offer a [Nginx config file](setup#optional-setup-ssl) template.
[This template](https://github.com/QubitPi/hashicorp-aws/blob/master/hashicorp/webservice/images/ssl/nginx-ssl.conf)
will be used by hashicorp-aws by default

:::

### Defining Packer Variables

Create a [HashiCorp Packer variable values file] named **aws-ws.auto.pkrvars.hcl** under one of the subdirectory of
**[hashicorp-aws/hashicorp/webservice/images]**, depending on the deployment mode, with the following contents:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="non-ssl" label="non-SSL/HTTPS" default>
    ```hcl title=hashicorp-aws/hashicorp/webservice/images/basic/aws-aws.auto.pkrvars.hcl
    ami_region                   = "my-aws-region"
    ami_name                     = "my-webservice"
    instance_type                = "<one of t2.micro/t2.small/t2.medium/t2.large/t2.xlarge/t2.2xlarge>"
    ws_war_path                  = "my-webservice-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war"
    ws_filebeat_config_file_path = "filebeat.yml"
    ```

    - `ami_region` is the [region][AWS regions] where webservice [AMI][AWS AMI] will be published to. The published
      image will be _private_
    - `ami_name` is the published AMI name; it can be arbitrary
    - `instance_type` is the [EC2 instance type][AWS EC2 instance type] to use while building the AMI, such as t2.small.
    - `ws_war_path` is the absolute path or the path relative to `hashicorp-aws/hashicorp/webservice/images/basic` of
      the webservice WAR file we are going to deploy
    - `ws_filebeat_config_file_path` is the absolute path or the path relative to
      `hashicorp-aws/hashicorp/webservice/images/basic` of the filebeat config file if the webservice is sending logs
      to ELK

      :::tip

      It is very important to connect webservice to an external logging & auditing service like ELK, because once
      webservice is deployed as an immutable infrastructure, it is completely sealed in a sense that no one can SSH into
      it. This means logs or other metrics are not available unless they are send to an external logging & auditing
      service such as ELK. Our HACP offers out-of-the box deployment of ELK and allow the webservice to automatically
      connect to it to send logs and metrics, which gives us a lot better experience on working with webservice logging
      & auditing.

  <TabItem value="ssl" label="SSL/HTTPS">
    ```hcl title=hashicorp-aws/hashicorp/webservice/images/ssl/aws-aws.auto.pkrvars.hcl
    ami_region                    = "my-aws-region"
    ami_name                      = "my-webservice"
    instance_type                 = "<one of t2.micro/t2.small/t2.medium/t2.large/t2.xlarge/t2.2xlarge>"
    ws_war_path                   = "my-webservice-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war"
    ws_filebeat_config_file_path  = "filebeat.yml"
    aws_ws_ssl_cert_file_path     = "server.crt"
    aws_ws_ssl_cert_key_file_path = "server.key"
    ```

    - `ami_region` is the [region][AWS regions] where webservice [AMI][AWS AMI] will be published to. The
      published image will be _private_
    - `ami_name` is the published [AMI][AWS AMI] name; it can be arbitrary

    - `ws_filebeat_config_file_path` is the absolute path or the path relative to
      `hashicorp-aws/hashicorp/webservice/images/ssl` of the filebeat config file if the webservice is sending logs
      to ELK

### Defining Terraform Variables

Create a [HashiCorp Terraform variable values file] named **aws-ws.auto.tfvars** under one of the subdirectory of
**[hashicorp-aws/hashicorp/webservice/instances]**, depending on the deployment mode, with the following contents:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="non-ssl" label="non-SSL/HTTPS" default>
    ```hcl title=hashicorp-aws/hashicorp/webservice/instances/basic/aws-ws.auto.tfvars
    aws_deploy_region = "my-aws-region"
    ami_name          = "my-webservice"
    instance_type     = "<one of t2.micro/t2.small/t2.medium/t2.large/t2.xlarge/t2.2xlarge>"
    ec2_instance_name = "My Webservice"
    security_groups   = ["My Webservice"]
    ```

    - `aws_deploy_region` is the [EC2 runtime region][AWS regions]
    - `ami_name` is the name of the published AMI; **it must be the same as the `ami_name` in
      [Packer variable file](#defining-packer-variables)**
    - `instance_type` is the chosen [AWS EC2 instance type] at runtime
    - `ec2_instance_name` is the deployed EC2 name as appeared in the instance list of AWS console; it can be arbitrary
    - `security_groups` is the list of [AWS Security Group] _names_ to associate with (yes, not ID, but name...)

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="ssl" label="SSL/HTTPS">
    ```hcl title=hashicorp-aws/hashicorp/webservice/instances/ssl/aws-ws.auto.tfvars
    aws_deploy_region = "my-aws-region"
    ami_name          = "my-webservice"
    instance_type     = "<one of t2.micro/t2.small/t2.medium/t2.large/t2.xlarge/t2.2xlarge>"
    ec2_instance_name = "My Webservice"
    security_groups   = ["My Webservice"]
    route_53_zone_id  = "9DQXLTNSN7ZX9P8V2KZII"
    ws_domain         = "mywebservice.mycompany.com"
    ```

    - `aws_deploy_region` is the [EC2 runtime region][AWS regions]
    - `ami_name` is the name of the published AMI; **it must be the same as the `ami_name` in
      [Packer variable file](#defining-packer-variables)**
    - `instance_type` is the chosen [AWS EC2 instance type] at runtime
    - `ec2_instance_name` is the deployed EC2 name as appeared in the instance list of AWS console; it can be arbitrary
    - `security_groups` is the list of [AWS Security Group] _names_ to associate with (yes, not ID, but name...)
    - `ws_domain` is the SSL-enabled domain that will serve webservice API URL

      :::warning

      Although the `ws_domain` is a public identity, hashicorp-aws will bind a **private IP** address to this domain,
      because webservice tend to be deployed in a virtual private network and AWS also requires
      [EC2 instances of different Security Groups to communicate through private IP](https://serverfault.com/a/967483)

      :::

    - `route_53_zone_id` is the AWS Route 53 hosted Zone ID that hosts the domain `mywebservice.mycompany.com`

      :::tip

      To find the zone ID in AWS Route 53, we can:

      1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console
      2. Open the Route 53 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/
      3. Select Hosted zones in the navigation pane
      4. Find the requested ID in the top level Hosted Zones summary in the Route 53 section

### Deploying to EC2

:::caution

Depending on the [AMI](#defining-packer-variables) and [EC2](#defining-terraform-variables) configs, **please be aware
AWS credit charges shall incur after the following commands execute**

:::

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="non-ssl" label="non-SSL/HTTPS" default>
    ```console
    cd ../instances/basic
    terraform init
    terraform validate
    terraform apply -auto-approve
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="ssl" label="SSL/HTTPS">
    ```console
    cd ../instances/ssl
    terraform init
    terraform validate
    terraform apply -auto-approve
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Deployment via Screwdriver CD
-----------------------------

hashicorp-aws also support deployment using [Screwdriver CD] with this [Jersey Webservice release definition templates]

Deployment via GitHub Actions
-----------------------------

Deployment via HACP
-------------------

:::tip

Please try our HACP platform to deploy a Webservice instance. It gives us one-click experience that helps us stand up
a webservice in a minute.

:::

Troubleshooting
---------------

### AWS

#### The Webservice was Running Properly Right After Deployment, but NOT After a While with "503 Service Unavailable"

This could be the resource starvation on EC2 instance. Please try using a bigger EC2 sizes. For example, bumping
_t2.micro_ to _t2.medium_. hashicorp-aws currently supports **t2.x** sizes, i.e. one of the following sizes can be
selected:

- t2.micro
- t2.small
- t2.medium
- t2.large
- t2.xlarge
- t2.2xlarge

To modify the size, set the value of `instance_type` in both _aws-ws.pkrvars.hcl_ and _aws-ws.tfvars_. For
example:

```hcl
instance_type       = "t2.medium"
```
