A matrix strategy lets you use variables in a single job definition to automatically create multiple job runs that are
based on the combinations of the variables. For example, you can use a matrix strategy to test your code in multiple
versions of a language or on multiple operating systems.

Using a Matrix Strategy
-----------------------

Use `jobs.<job_id>.strategy.matrix` to define a matrix of different job configurations. Within your matrix, define one
or more variables followed by an array of values. For example, the following matrix has a variable called `version` with
the value `[10, 12, 14]` and a variable called os with the value `[ubuntu-latest, windows-latest]`:

```yaml
jobs:
  example_matrix:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        version: [10, 12, 14]
        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest]
```

A job will run for each possible combination of the variables. In this example, the workflow will run six jobs, one for
each combination of the `os` and `version` variables.

By default, GitHub will maximize the number of jobs run in parallel depending on runner availability. The **order of the
variables in the matrix determines the order in which the jobs are created**. The first variable you define will be the
first job that is created in your workflow run. For example, the above matrix will create the jobs in the following
order:

- `{version: 10, os: ubuntu-latest}`
- `{version: 10, os: windows-latest}`
- `{version: 12, os: ubuntu-latest}`
- `{version: 12, os: windows-latest}`
- `{version: 14, os: ubuntu-latest}`
- `{version: 14, os: windows-latest}`

A matrix will generate a maximum of **256** jobs per workflow run. This limit applies to both GitHub-hosted and
self-hosted runners.

The variables that you define become properties in the matrix context, and you can reference the property in other areas
of your workflow file. In this example, you can use `matrix.version` and `matrix.os` to access the current value of
version and os that the job is using. For more information, see "[Contexts][Contexts]."

Example: Using a Single-Dimension Matrix
----------------------------------------

You can specify a single variable to create a single-dimension matrix.

For example, the following workflow defines the variable version with the values `[10, 12, 14]`. The workflow will run
three jobs, one for each value in the variable. Each job will access the version value through the `matrix.version`
context and pass the value as `node-version` to the actions/setup-node action.

Example: Using a Multi-dimension Matrix
---------------------------------------

You can specify multiple variables to create a multi-dimensional matrix. A job will run for each possible combination of
the variables.

For example, the following workflow specifies two variables:

- Two operating systems specified in the `os` variable
- Three Node.js versions specified in the `version` variable

The workflow will run six jobs, one for each combination of the `os` and `version` variables. Each job will set the
`runs-on` value to the current `os` value and will pass the current version value to the `actions/setup-node` action.

```yaml
jobs:
  example_matrix:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-22.04, ubuntu-20.04]
        version: [10, 12, 14]
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.version }}
```

Example: Using Contexts to Create Matrices
------------------------------------------

You can use contexts to create matrices. For more information about contexts, see "[Contexts][Contexts]."

For example, the following workflow triggers on the `repository_dispatch` event and uses information from the event
payload to build the matrix. When a repository dispatch event is created with a payload like the one below, the matrix
`version` variable will have a value of `[12, 14, 16]`. For more information about the `repository_dispatch` trigger,
see "[Events that trigger workflows][Events that trigger workflows]."

```json
{
    "event_type": "test",
    "client_payload": {
        "versions": [12, 14, 16]
    }
}
```

```yaml
on:
  repository_dispatch:
    types:
      - test

jobs:
  example_matrix:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        version: ${{ github.event.client_payload.versions }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.version }}
```

Expanding or adding matrix configurations
-----------------------------------------

Use `jobs.<job_id>.strategy.matrix.include` to expand existing matrix configurations or to add new configurations. The
value of include is a list of objects.

For each object in the `include` list, the key:value pairs in the object will be added to each of the matrix
combinations if none of the key:value pairs overwrite any of the original matrix values. If the object cannot be added
to any of the matrix combinations, a new matrix combination will be created instead. Note that the original matrix
values will not be overwritten, but added matrix values can be overwritten.

For example, this matrix:

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    fruit: [apple, pear]
    animal: [cat, dog]
    include:
      - color: green
      - color: pink
        animal: cat
      - fruit: apple
        shape: circle
      - fruit: banana
      - fruit: banana
        animal: cat
```

will result in six jobs with the following matrix combinations:

- `{fruit: apple, animal: cat, color: pink, shape: circle}`
- `{fruit: apple, animal: dog, color: green, shape: circle}`
- `{fruit: pear, animal: cat, color: pink}`
- `{fruit: pear, animal: dog, color: green}`
- `{fruit: banana}`
- `{fruit: banana, animal: cat}`

following this logic:

- `{color: green}` is added to all of the original matrix combinations because it can be added without overwriting any
  part of the original combinations.
- `{color: pink, animal: cat}` adds `color:pink` only to the original matrix combinations that include `animal: cat`.
  This overwrites the color: green that was added by the previous include entry.
- `{fruit: apple, shape: circle}` adds shape: circle only to the original matrix combinations that include
  `fruit: apple`.
- `{fruit: banana}` cannot be added to any original matrix combination without overwriting a value, so it is added as an
  additional matrix combination.
- `{fruit: banana, animal: cat}` cannot be added to any original matrix combination without overwriting a value, so it
  is added as an additional matrix combination. It does not add to the `{fruit: banana}` matrix combination because that
  combination was not one of the original matrix combinations.

This looks like kinda "what're we doing here???". But let us just look at the following examples which make it more
clear.

The following workflow will run six jobs, one for each combination of `os` and node. When the job for the os value of
`windows-latest` and node value of `16` runs, an additional variable called `npm` with the value of `6` will be included
in the job.

```yaml
jobs:
  example_matrix:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [windows-latest, ubuntu-latest]
        node: [12, 14, 16]
        include:
          - os: windows-latest
            node: 16
            npm: 6
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node }}
      - if: ${{ matrix.npm }}
        run: npm install -g npm@${{ matrix.npm }}
      - run: npm --version
```

This matrix will run 10 jobs, one for each combination of `os` and `version` in the matrix, plus a job for the `os`
value of `windows-latest` and version value of `17`.

```yaml
jobs:
  example_matrix:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [macos-latest, windows-latest, ubuntu-latest]
        version: [12, 14, 16]
        include:
          - os: windows-latest
            version: 17
```

If you don't specify any matrix variables, all configurations under `include` will run. For example, the following
workflow would run two jobs, one for each `include` entry. This lets you take advantage of the matrix strategy without
having a fully populated matrix.

```yaml
jobs:
  includes_only:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        include:
          - site: "production"
            datacenter: "site-a"
          - site: "staging"
            datacenter: "site-b"
```

Excluding Matrix Configurations
-------------------------------

To remove specific configurations defined in the matrix, use `jobs.<job_id>.strategy.matrix.exclude`. An excluded
configuration only has to be a partial match for it to be excluded. For example, the following workflow will run nine
jobs: one job for each of the 12 configurations, minus the one excluded job that matches
`{os: macos-latest, version: 12, environment: production}`, and the two excluded jobs that match
`{os: windows-latest, version: 16}`.

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    os: [macos-latest, windows-latest]
    version: [12, 14, 16]
    environment: [staging, production]
    exclude:
      - os: macos-latest
        version: 12
        environment: production
      - os: windows-latest
        version: 16
runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
```

> Note: All `include` combinations are processed after `exclude`. This allows you to use `include` to add back
> combinations that were previously excluded.

Handling Failures
-----------------

You can control how job failures are handled with `jobs.<job_id>.strategy.fail-fast` and
`jobs.<job_id>.continue-on-error`.

`jobs.<job_id>.strategy.fail-fast` applies to the entire matrix. If `jobs.<job_id>.strategy.fail-fast` is set to `true`,
GitHub will cancel all in-progress and queued jobs in the matrix if any job in the matrix fails. This property defaults
to `true`.

`jobs.<job_id>.continue-on-error` applies to a single job. If `jobs.<job_id>.continue-on-error` is `true`, other jobs in
the matrix will continue running even if the job with `jobs.<job_id>.continue-on-error: true` fails.

You can use `jobs.<job_id>.strategy.fail-fast` and `jobs.<job_id>.continue-on-error` together. For example, the
following workflow will start four jobs. For each job, continue-on-error is determined by the value of
`matrix.experimental`. If any of the jobs with `continue-on-error: false` fail, all jobs that are in progress or queued
will be cancelled. If the job with `continue-on-error: true` fails, the other jobs will not be affected.

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    continue-on-error: ${{ matrix.experimental }}
    strategy:
      fail-fast: true
      matrix:
        version: [6, 7, 8]
        experimental: [false]
        include:
          - version: 9
            experimental: true
```

Configuring the Maximum Number of Concurrent Jobs
-------------------------------------------------

By default, GitHub will maximize the number of jobs run in parallel depending on runner availability. To set the maximum
number of jobs that can run simultaneously when using a `matrix` job strategy, use
`jobs.<job_id>.strategy.max-parallel`.

For example, the following workflow will run a maximum of two jobs at a time, even if there are runners available to run
all six jobs at once.

```yaml
jobs:
  example_matrix:
    strategy:
      max-parallel: 2
      matrix:
        version: [10, 12, 14]
        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest]
```
