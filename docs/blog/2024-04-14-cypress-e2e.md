:::info

This action assumes the [yarn package manager](https://yarnpkg.com/) is used.

:::

Cypress E2E action offers an easy way to automate, customize, and execute **parallel** end-to-end tests. The action
provides

- dependency installation via **yarn**,
- scanning of test specs,
- running each spec in parallel, and
- upload test screenshots and video on test failure.

The example below is a very simple setup:

1. Install Cypress with `yarn add cypress --dev`
2. Initialize Cypress with `yarn run cypress open`
3. [Support TypeScript](https://qubitpi.github.io/cypress-documentation/guides/tooling/typescript-support/)
4. Put all **.spec.cy.ts** test files under "cypress/e2e" directory
5. Install [wait-on]: `yarn add -D wait-on`
6. Add the following script command to `package.json`:

   ```json
   {
     ...

     "scripts": {
       "e2e": "cypress run --browser chrome",
       "wait-on-dev": "wait-on http-get://localhost:3000/",
       "wait-on-prod": "wait-on http-get://localhost:3000/"
     },

     ...
   }
   ```

   :::info

   Note that we assume the UI is running at port 3000. Please adjust it accordingly if it's running at a different port.

8. Use Cypress E2E Tests workflow:

   ```yaml

           start_strategy: ["yarn-start", "serve"]
           test_spec: ${{ fromJson(needs.list-e2e-specs.outputs.paths) }}
       steps:

           uses: actions/setup-node@v3
           with:
             node-version: ${{ inputs.node-version }}
         - name: Install dependencies
           run: yarn
         - uses: QubitPi/hashicorp-aws/.github/actions/cypress-e2e@master
           with:
             node-version: ${{ env.NODE_VERSION }}
             start-strategy: ${{ matrix.start_strategy }}
             spec-relative-path: ${{ matrix.test_spec }}
   ```

   :::tip

   The **start_strategy** in the `mastrix` section above specifies how the UI web app is started during the E2E test.
   There are 2 strategies:

   1. **yarn-start**: the web app is started using `yarn start`
   2. **server**: a production build is generated first using `yarn build` and then the web app is started with
      `yarn serve`

   The reason to support the two strategies is that we assume E2E testing consists of 2 logical parts:

   1. The logical tests defined by Cypress spec files
   2. The same tests in the context of integration of web app logic and the production runtime
  github-actions-core
   The app may work perfectly fine in E2E but it's a different question when the same app is packaged up using
   [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). The later could also be interpreted as integration tests against webpackgithub-actions-core
   configuration which makes the tests more comprehensive
