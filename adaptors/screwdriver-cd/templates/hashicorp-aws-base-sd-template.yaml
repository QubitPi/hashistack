description: |
  Screwdriver CD base template for deploying an immutable infrastructure to AWS through HashiCorp.
  The template installs all required packages for running HashiCorp commands, publishes a regular AMI, and deploys an
  EC2 instance of it to AWS.

    ami-region:

      description: |
        The name of the resulting AMI that will appear when managing AMIs in the AWS console or via APIs.
        This can be the same across builds, because hashicorp-aws will deregister the old AMI with the same name and
        replace it with the current built one.
